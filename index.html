            <p>Hi, my name is Hayden Webber and I'm currently a high school student who wants to 
                pursue Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>I don't have a ton of experience but I'm currently trying to work on a game called Business School.
                I haven't made a ton of progress on it 
            </p>
